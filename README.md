# Frontend Mentor - Blog preview card solution

This is my solution to the [Blog preview card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01Rc). Frontend Mentor challenges help me improve my front-end development skills by building real-world components.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Queries
- [Figtree](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Figtree) font

### What I learned

This challenge helped me understand and apply **media queries** to make a card component fully responsive. I also practiced consistent use of variables and layout techniques using **flexbox** and responsive sizing (`max-width`, `rem`, `%`).

### Continued development

I plan to focus more on:
- Creating mobile-first layouts with smoother breakpoints
- Using relative units (`rem`, `em`) instead of fixed `px`
- Improving accessibility and performance
